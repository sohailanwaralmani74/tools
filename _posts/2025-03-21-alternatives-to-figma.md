As a software engineer, product manager, or product designer, you must have heard of Figma. View and design are essential parts of any software product, and Figma has become a leading tool for UI/UX design and prototyping.

While Figma is known for its real-time collaboration and cloud-based approach, it comes with limitations. Subscription costs can be a burden for freelancers and small teams. Offline work is restricted, making it unreliable in low-connectivity environments. Data privacy is another concern, as designs are stored on Figmaâ€™s servers with no option for self-hosting. Additionally, Linux users are left out with no native application.

If you need more freedom, flexibility, and control, open-source alternatives are worth considering. Whether it's cost savings, offline access, or complete ownership of your designs, these tools offer powerful features without restrictions. Explore the best open-source design tools today and design on your own terms.  Below are the tools that you should consider for your needs. I like penpot and thats why I am placing it at top of the list.
